# Project4-DifferentialEquations
PSI Numerical Methods (2022/2023) course project 4. The solutions for the problems are in the file ``Project4-SercanHusnugil.ipynb`` file, written in Julia v1.8.4.

In this project, we aim to demonstrate how to utilize `julia` for solving differential equations. Specifically, we focus on the wave equation and some of its properties. We make extensive use of the code implemented in lectures by Erik Schnetter (https://pirsa.org/C23003).

In Problem 1, we use finite difference methods to evaluate the 1+1 dimensional wave equation. We impose Dirichlet boundary conditions so that the amplitude of the wave diminishes on the space the boundaries. The initial condition is a Gaussian-like wave of which a plot is shown below.
